## The focus is on writing an exhaustive report about the code analysis (i.e. hotspot identification) and on the iterative process to parallelise the code.

## During the discussion I will ask you also some theoretical questions (e.g. what is the speedup and how you compute it). If you do not answer correctly you must repeat the exam at least one month later.

### Send me report(s)+code(s) at least one week before - strict requirement - you want to discuss the project during the normal exam sessions.

#Â you must conclude with a discussion and comparison of the performance achievable in the three cases. Incomplete (e.g. qualitative and not quantitative) reports will be rejected. In particular
- describe always the compute capability of the resource you are using;
- use ICC/ICX on our workstations, GCC with Colab;
- use the BEST sequential execution time;
- always provide the compilation and execution commands (e.g. icc -O3 -xHost...);
- consider different and meaningful data sizes (i.e. no sequential execution time shorter than a few seconds).
